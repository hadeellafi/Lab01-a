# Numbers Game

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate exception handling and basic mathematical operations on user-provided numbers. It allows users to input an array of numbers, calculates the sum, product, and quotient based on the user's inputs, and handles various exceptions that may occur during the process.

## How to Run the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (`Numbers_Game.sln`) in your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build the solution to compile the code.
4. Run the program by starting the application.
